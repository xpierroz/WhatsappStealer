## WhatsApp Stealer 🪖

This program steal the victim's WhatsApp data such as profile pictures of conversations and more

## How to use 📖

* Download this repository
* Make sure you have python installed
* Start builder.cmd
* Create a payload (the program will ask you if you wanna compile the payload)
* Send the payload to your victim and make it execute it
* Don't forget this is a POC and that this shouldn't be used for malicious purposes, i'm not responsible for your actions

## How it works 🤔

The victim's payload will actually make a zip of all the WhatsApp data located at `LOCALAPPDATA\\Packages\\5319275A.WhatsAppDesktop_cv1g1gvanyjgm` 
Then, it's gonna uplaod it to the gofile API and send to the webhook the link
