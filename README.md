## WhatsApp Stealer ⭐️

This program is a POC that's its actually very easy to steal anyone's WhatsApp data

## How it works 🤔

The victim's payload will actually make a zip of all the WhatsApp data located at `LOCALAPPDATA\\Packages\\5319275A.WhatsAppDesktop_cv1g1gvanyjgm` 
Then, it's gonna uplaod it to the gofile API and send to the webhook the link
